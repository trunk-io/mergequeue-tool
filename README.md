![trunk merge queue tool](https://github.com/trunk-io/mergequeue-tool/assets/1265982/6fa28185-6b75-467c-83b2-273a05dbbba4)

### Welcome

This repository hosts the trunk mergequeue-tool which can be used to demonstrate the performance
characteristics of repository managed by trunk merge graph under different simulated loads.

#### How does it work

```bash
Usage: mq [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]

Commands:
  generate       Generate pull requests
  test-sim       Simulate a test with flake rate in consideration
  housekeeping   Clean out conflicting PRs and requeue failed PRs
  config         Print current configuration content to json
  defaultconfig  Generate default configuration content

Options:
      --gh-token <GH_TOKEN>  [default: ]
  -h, --help                 Print help
  -V, --version              Print version
```

#### Generate

Running `mq generate` will attempt to generate pull requests at the configured rate. Generate can
operate in two different modes. By setting the mutually exclusive requests_per_hour or
requests_per_run value you are specifying to either run in either distributed mode which will try to
distribute the generate load across the specified `run_generate_for` value or burst mode which will
attempt to create pull requests as quickly as possible given the specified `requests_per_run` value.

Burst Mode configuration to create 20 pull requests as quickly as possible

```toml
requests_per_run: 20
```

Distributed Mode configuration to create 25 pull requests over 15 minutes time

```toml
requests_per_hour = 100
run_generate_for = "15 minutes"
```

#### Configuration

The load imparted onto the connected queue is controlled by the `mq.toml` file in the .config
folder.

The configuration system allows for setting the desired load on the queue, the flake rate and the
interdependence element of the pull requests. The tooling is designed to generate pull requests
assuming `mq generate` is called every 10 minutes.
