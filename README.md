![trunk merge queue tool](https://github.com/trunk-io/mergequeue-tool/assets/1265982/6fa28185-6b75-467c-83b2-273a05dbbba4)

### Welcome

This repository hosts the trunk mergequeue-tool which can be used to demonstrate the performance
characteristics of repository managed by trunk merge graph under different simulated loads.

#### How does it work

```bash
Usage: mq [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]

Commands:
  generate       Generate pull requests
  test-sim       Simulate a test with flake rate in consideration
  housekeeping   Clean out conflicting PRs and requeue failed PRs
  config         Print current configuration content to json
  defaultconfig  Generate default configuration content for generator    

Options:
      --gh-token <GH_TOKEN>  [default: ]
  -h, --help                 Print help
  -V, --version              Print version
```

#### Configuration

The load imparted onto the connected queue is controlled by the `mq.toml` file in the .config
folder.

The configuration system allows for setting the desired load on the queue, the flake rate and the
interdependence element of the pull requests. The tooling is designed to generate pull requests assuming 
`mq generate` is called every 10 minutes. 

```toml
# parallelqueue - will push deps information to the service to take advantage of trunk merge dynamic parallel queues
